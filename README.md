# Billards USA 

The mission for me creating this project is to inspire and help a new generation of billiards players in the USA. As I travel around and play at different pool halls, I can't help but feel that I am one of the few in my generation that have truly come to appreciate billiards games. I think one reason for this is that there is not an easy enough way to access information about where, when, and what to do. For example, if you wanted to find out the price to play somewhere, most of the time you end up calling in order to find out as many of pool halls are not yet caught up to today's technology. The same thing must be done in order to find out what kind of tables are in that establishment, the sizes of the tables, etc. I want to create an easy way for these owners to transition to the new age of technology and to interact with the pool community.
