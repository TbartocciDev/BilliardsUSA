# Billards USA 

The mission for me creating this project is to inspire and help a new generation of billiards players in the USA. As I travel around and play at different pool halls, I can't help but feel that I am one of the few in my generation that have truly come to appreciate billiards games. I think one reason for this is that there is not an easy enough way to access information about where, when, and what to do. For example, if you wanted to find out the price to play somewhere, most of the time you end up calling in order to find out as many of pool halls are not yet caught up to today's technology. The same thing must be done in order to find out what kind of tables are in that establishment, the sizes of the tables, etc. I want to create an easy way for these owners to transition to the new age of technology and to interact with the pool community.

### Some Ideas

This very well could end up being some sort of social media for billiards players, however that is not my initial intent. So far I just have a few ideas of an app that I would like the create.

- A map showing local pool halls, or other places to play
  - Will give details of each pool hall
    - Price per hour
    - Specials
    - Types of tables: types, sizes
    - Hours of operation
    - Ratings: by google
    - Leagues ran thru?
- A nearby events section
  - Tournaments
- A learning section
  - Rules of games
  - Drills to practice
  - Tips from the pros
- The creation zone
  - Create trickshots?
